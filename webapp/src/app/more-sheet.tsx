 * What the seventh slot opens.

 * A native `<dialog>` opened with `showModal`, because that is where the focus
 * trap, the Escape key and the inertness of the page behind come from. Writing
 * those by hand is how an accessibility gate starts failing, and this one is
 * measured — the suite runs axe over the sheet while it is open.
 *
 * Rendered only when there is something behind it: an account that may neither
 * upload nor administer still has six entries hidden, but a listing with
 * nothing in it would be a control that does nothing.
